The implementation wraps all the Dart Goodness to deliver lightweight implementation was possible.  \r\n\r\n### Usage Examples\r\n\r\n_The code before can be run from examples/darpule.dart._\r\n\r\nJust one easy way to create an immutable tuple with _n_ elements. Using a single generative constructor, development time type checking was deliberately traded off. Insteadof using generics to parametrise multiple Tuple types, functional predicates where used for dynamic runtime type checking.\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n    /// Created in a very ad-hoc.\r\n    \r\n    List resultFromSomeWhere = ['Longhaul', 382, 982.23, false];\r\n    \r\n    Tuple payload = new Tuple(resultFromSomeWhere);\r\n    \r\n    assert(payload is Tuple);\r\n    assert(payload.type == TupleType.quadruple);\r\n    assert(payload.elementCount == 4);\r\n    \r\n    /// Tuple can hold anything.\r\n    Tuple collective = new Tuple([\r\n      true,\r\n      new Tuple([343, false]),\r\n      new DateTime.now()\r\n    ]);\r\n    \r\n    assert(collective is Tuple);\r\n    assert(collective.type == TupleType.triple);\r\n    \r\n```\r\n\r\nSo as not to reinvent the wheel the Tuple type just extends Dart's [UnmodifiableListView](https://api.dartlang.org/134830/dart-collection/UnmodifiableListView-class.html), which has a reasonably small footprint. This provides the iterator goodness for locating stuff. Just no modification after construction.\r\n\r\nYou can also just call the Tuple instance, and it returns a list of its elements that you can modify in any way. When ready pass that list back into a Tuple constructor, and we have a new immutable Tuple.\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n    /// Ways to get a tuple elements\r\n    \r\n    Tuple notSameContent = new Tuple([8827, 'sad']);\r\n\r\n    assert(collective[0] == true); // Using element position number.\r\n    \r\n    List tupleContent = notSameContent(); // Call your tuple like a function.\r\n    \r\n    assert(tupleContent[0] == 8827 && tupleContent[1] == 'sad');\r\n    \r\n    tupleContent.add('Now we can mutate the resulting list');\r\n    \r\n    Tuple notSameContentWithMore = new Tuple(tupleContent); // Back to a tuple.\r\n    \r\n    assert (notSameContentWithMore is Tuple);\r\n    assert (notSameContent.type == TupleType.pairple);\r\n    assert (notSameContentWithMore.type == TupleType.triple);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBeside UnmodifiableList View not supporting mutations, we have introduced an [MutabilityError] just so you can blow up when something attempts mutate your tuple.\r\n```dart\r\n    /// Tuple is Immutable, trying results in an programming error.\r\n  \r\n    try {\r\n      payload.add('WantToAddElement');\r\n    } catch (error) {\r\n      assert(error is MutabilityError);\r\n    }\r\n  \r\n    try {\r\n      payload.addAll(['doctor', 'drugs']);\r\n    } catch (error) {\r\n      assert(error is MutabilityError);\r\n    }\r\n  \r\n    try {\r\n      payload.removeAt(0);\r\n    } catch (error) {\r\n      assert (error is MutabilityError);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n \r\nEqual is based upon the content and structure of the tuple.\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n    /// Hash and Equals behaviour\r\n\r\n    assert(collective != payload);\r\n    \r\n    Tuple sameContent1 = new Tuple([3902, 'happy']);\r\n    Tuple sameContent2 = new Tuple([3902, 'happy']);\r\n    \r\n    assert(sameContent1 == sameContent2); // They have same elements.\r\n    assert(identical(sameContent1, sameContent2) == false); // But are unique.\r\n    \r\n    Tuple notSameContent = new Tuple([8827, 'sad']);\r\n    \r\n    Tuple deepLikeness = new Tuple(['skindeep', sameContent1]);\r\n    Tuple deeperLikeness = new Tuple(['skindeep', sameContent1]);\r\n    Tuple downDeep = new Tuple(['skindeep', notSameContent]);\r\n    \r\n    assert(deepLikeness == deeperLikeness);\r\n    assert(downDeep != deepLikeness);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is all very nice and neat, but the only type we have it is 'Tuple'. This is where predicates come into play. It easily to become a Tupleholic and when you end up with functions that accept any Tuple, a real mess can appear overnight. Hence the Predicate library, given that we have a list of typed elements within the tuple we may as well see what funky, functional things we can do.\r\n\r\nWithout importing the predicate library, you can use the [elementTypesOf(Tuple tuple)] to get a tuple of the element types as [Type].\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n    /// Finding out what the elements are at runtime.\r\n\r\n    Tuple typesInPayload = elementTypesOf(payload);\r\n    \r\n    assert(typesInPayload[0] == String );\r\n    assert(typesInPayload[1] == int);\r\n    assert(typesInPayload[2] == double);\r\n    assert(typesInPayload[3] == bool);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy importing the predicate library, you can start do a few more things. All the Predicates evaluate to True or False, True being yes and False being no.\r\n```dart\r\n    /// Predicate can help you answer some questions about the Tuple.\r\n\r\n    assert(isSepTuple(payload) == false); // No it does not have 7 elements.\r\n    assert(isQuadruple(payload) == true); // Yes it does have 4 elements\r\n    assert(isLeaf(deepLikeness) == false); // No one of elements is a Tuple.\r\n    assert(isLeaf(sameContent1) == true); // Yes, no other tuple are inside.\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately life is never that clean, sometimes we want to partial match some elements and we happy if other are are whatever type. To achieve this we use [Object] as a wildcard place holder.\r\n \r\n```dart\r\n   /// Looking inside for a pattern.\r\n     \r\n   Tuple strictPattern = new Tuple ([String, int, double, bool]);\r\n   Tuple loosePattern = new Tuple ([String, Object, double, Object]);\r\n   \r\n   assert (isTupleTypeMatched(payload, strictPattern) == true);\r\n   assert (isTupleTypeMatched(payload, loosePattern) == true);\r\n   \r\n   /// Sometimes you don't get what you want.\r\n   \r\n   Tuple expectedTuplePattern = new Tuple ([String, int, int, bool]);\r\n   assert(isTupleTypeMatched(payload, expectedTuplePattern) == false);\r\n   \r\n   /// Sometimes you don't get enough of what you want.\r\n   \r\n   Tuple veryLoosePattern = new Tuple ([Object, Object, Object, Object, Object]);\r\n   assert(isTupleTypeMatched(payload, veryLoosePattern) == false); \r\n```\r\n\r\nThings also have a way of being odd shaped, fuzzy around the edges or just not complete but we can live with it. So we bring [Optional] into play, it allows the element to be present or not present. Conditionally if it is present it we can ensure that is of a certain type.\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n   /// Real life is fuzzy\r\n   \r\n   Tuple acceptableStandard =\r\n       new Tuple([String, int, double, Object, new Optional.of(bool)]);\r\n   assert(isTupleTypeMatched(payload, acceptableStandard) == true);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Limitations & Alternatives\r\n\r\n- This Package is not designed to deliver a collection of Tuple nor a classic tuple space.\r\n- [tuple](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/tuple) provides stronger type implementation, has nice way to layer a tuple within a tuple.\r\n- [duty](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/duty) provides more then a Tuple but does have type safe containers for a Monuple, Pairple and Triple.\r\n- [vacuum_persistent] (https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/vacuum_persistent) provide a complete persistence with immutable data structures.\r\n\r\nIf a packages should be on this list and is not, just add it via a pull request or rise an [issue](https://github.com/rayk/darpule/issues/new).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
